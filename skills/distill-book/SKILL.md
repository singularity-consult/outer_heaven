name: distill-book
description: Distill a long book into a concise, structured set of learnings by processing it chapter by chapter with parallel subagents, then synthesizing the short overviews. Format-agnostic (PDF, EPUB, Markdown, HTML, plain text). Use this whenever the user wants to summarize, distill, extract the core ideas from, or "turn into a skill" a book, ebook, manual, or other long-form document too large to read in one pass. Triggers include "distill this book", "summarize this book chapter by chapter", "extract the key principles from this PDF/ebook", "make a skill out of this book", or handing over a large multi-chapter document and asking what to learn from it.

# distill-book

## The core idea

A book is too large to load into one context window and reason about well. So fan it out: split the book into chapters, hand each chapter to its own subagent that distills it in isolation, then read back the short overviews, not the raw chapters, and synthesize from those.

The point is **context hygiene**. Each subagent loads exactly one chapter, and the orchestrator never reads a full chapter, so the approach scales to any size of book. If you catch yourself pulling raw chapter text into your own context, you have lost the benefit. Delegate it.

This skill stays deliberately high-level and format-agnostic. A book might arrive as a PDF, EPUB, Markdown, HTML, plain text, or something else. Use whatever tools suit that format. The workflow is what matters, not the mechanics.

## When to use this skill

Use it when someone wants the core learnings out of a long document (book, manual, report) too big to read in one go, especially when the result should become a skill or a structured overview. For short documents that fit in context, read them directly; this machinery is overkill.

## Workflow

1. **Check the source is usable, and flag problems before grinding.** Confirm you can get real, extractable text out of the document, whatever its format. Some formats need a step first: a scanned PDF has no extractable text at all, HTML may need its markup stripped. Markdown or plain text is ready as-is. For PDFs, use the `pdf` skill, which also tells you fast when a PDF is scanned and therefore unusable without OCR. If the source will not yield usable text, say so up front rather than after a long process.

2. **Break it into chapters (or natural sections).** Read the book's own structure, its table of contents and headings, to find the boundaries. Conventions vary wildly between books, so this is a judgment call, not a fixed rule. Verify the split looks sane before spending tokens on it. With no clear chapters, fall back to Parts, sections, or sensible chunks, and say what you did. Usually skip front and back matter (preface, index, appendices) unless it is worth distilling.

3. **Distill each chapter in parallel.** Spawn one subagent per chapter, all in a single batch so they run concurrently. Each subagent prompt must be self-contained, and should include:
   - which chapter to read, plus the book and chapter title for context;
   - a **focus lens matched to the end goal**. This matters more than anything else. For a coding skill, ask for principles and practices an engineer can actually apply: definitions, the why, concrete techniques, anti-patterns, rules of thumb, not a flat summary. For a book report, ask for narrative takeaways. The lens shapes everything downstream.
   - an instruction to **write its overview to a file and reply with only a short token** (for example "done ch5"). Writing to files keeps the overviews out of the orchestrator's context until you choose to read them.
   - a length target and a "do not pad" nudge.

4. **Synthesize.** Read the overviews back. They are small individually, but together can be large, so page through them or use a synthesis subagent for a very large book. Then produce the deliverable: a distillation document organized by theme rather than chapter order, or, when the goal is reusable guidance, a skill by handing off to the `skill-creator` skill. Distill into your own words; you rarely need to quote the book.

5. **Clean up** the intermediate working files unless the user wants them kept.

## Keep in mind

- Subagents are independent with no shared memory. Every prompt stands alone.
- Respect copyright. This is for distilling a book the user has legitimately obtained into their own notes or tooling, not for reproducing it wholesale.
